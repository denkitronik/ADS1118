# Arduino Library for Texas Instruments ADS1118 - 16-Bit Analog-to-Digital Converter with internal Reference and Temperature Sensor

This is an easy to use Arduino library for ADC Converter ADS1118

## Getting Started

Learn with the examples provided: For basic use "basicExampleAds1118" and "ads1118example" for a detailed use.

### Prerequisites

None


### Installing

Download this library as zip file, then click in "Sketch" -> "Include Library" ->"Add .ZIP Library" and select the zip file downloaded.

## Running the tests
1. Connect the ADS1118 in the 3.3v power supply pins of your Arduino.
2. Connect the ADS1118 CS pin to the pin 5 of your Arduino.
3. Connect the ADS1118 MISO (DOUT), MOSI(DIN) and SCLK pins to the MISO, MOSI and SCLK of your Arduino (search on internet "Arduino ICSP pinout").

|ARDUINO (ICSP PINS) |ADS1118 PINS |
| --- | --- |
| MOSI | DIN |
| MISO | DOUT |	
| SCLK | SCLK |
| 5 (change this pin to fit your needs) |CS |

4. Run the examples provided in your Arduino IDE. 
Go to "File" -> "Examples" -> "ADS1118 library" -> "basicExampleAds1118" or "ads1118example" 

## Example with a thermocouple
This is the typical circuit for a "thermocouple measurement system" as shown in the TI [ADS1118 datasheet page 32](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1118.pdf).
